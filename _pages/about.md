Hello. I am Tomáš Čelko, doctoral student at the Department of Computer Science Education, Charles University in Prague. My research focuses primarily on two areas. The first one is application of machine-learning in the area of particle physics. My second area of interest is in high performance computing in detector physics. Besides the support of Charles University, I collaborate with my colleagues from the Institute of Experimental and Applied Physics, Czech Technical University. 

Recently, I have developed a CUDA-based library for connected component analysis (also known as clustering) for Timepix3-like detectors, for more information, navigate to `projects > Parallel clustering library`.

This page lists a few results and projects that I participated in and some of my recent activities. Please note, that this page is still under construction.
